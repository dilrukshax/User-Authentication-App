# **Custom Login, Registration, Email Verification, and Password Recovery in ASP.NET Core MVC**

## **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates how to implement **custom login**, **registration**, **email verification**, and **password recovery** pages in an **ASP.NET Core MVC application** using the **Identity framework**. It leverages ASP.NET Coreâ€™s built-in **Identity** functionality and integrates a custom approach for managing user data, email verification, password recovery, and session management.

### **Key Features**
- **Custom User Authentication**: Build login and registration forms from scratch using ASP.NET Core Identity.
- **Password Management**: Implement password change and recovery features to enhance user security.
- **Email Verification**: Send email verification messages to users during the registration process.
- **User Sessions**: Support for "Remember Me" functionality using cookies to keep users logged in.
- **User Logout**: Allow users to log out and access login/registration pages.
- **Database Integration**: Uses SQL Server to manage user data and integrates with Entity Framework for data operations.

## **Setup Instructions**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### **1. Clone the Repository**

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CustomIdentityApp.git
cd CustomIdentityApp
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

Ensure that you have the **.NET SDK** installed. Run the following command to restore the dependencies:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### **3. Configure the Database**

The project uses **SQL Server** for storing user information. The connection string is located in `appsettings.json`:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=CustomIdentityDB;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
}
```

If you're using a different database server, update the connection string accordingly.

### **4. Apply Migrations**

Run the following commands to apply the initial migrations and set up the database:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```

### **5. Run the Application**

Start the application using the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

This will start the application locally. You can now access it in your browser at `https://localhost:5001`.
